    <h1>The Story</h1>

    <h3>A party of Orcs sent by Saruman and Sauron attack the Fellowship. Boromir tries to protect Merry and Pippin from
        the Orcs, but they kill him and capture the two Hobbits. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas decide to pursue the Orcs.
        The Orcs are killed by Riders of Rohan, led by Éomer. The Hobbits escape into Fangorn Forest, where they are
        befriended by the Ent Treebeard. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas track the hobbits to Fangorn, where they meet
        Gandalf: he explains that he killed the Balrog; he too was killed in the fight, but was sent back to
        Middle-earth. He is now Gandalf the White, replacing Saruman as chief of the wizards. They ride to Edoras,
        capital of Rohan. Gandalf frees King Théoden from the influence of Saruman's spy Gríma Wormtongue. Théoden
        musters his army and rides to the fortress of Helm's Deep; Gandalf departs to seek help from Treebeard. The Ents
        destroy Isengard, Saruman's stronghold, and flood it, trapping the wizard in the tower of Orthanc. Gandalf
        convinces Treebeard to send an army of Huorns to Théoden's aid. He brings an army of Riders of Rohan to Helm's
        Deep. They defeat the Orcs, who flee into the forest of Huorns and are destroyed. Gandalf, Théoden, Aragorn,
        Legolas, and Gimli ride to Isengard, where they find Merry and Pippin relaxing amidst the ruins. Gandalf offers
        Saruman a chance to turn away from evil. When Saruman refuses, Gandalf strips him of his rank and most of his
        powers. Wormtongue throws down a hard round object to try to kill Gandalf. Pippin picks it up; Gandalf swiftly
        takes it, but Pippin steals it in the night. It is a palantír, a seeing-stone that Saruman used to speak with
        Sauron, becoming ensnared. Sauron sees Pippin, but misunderstands the circumstances. Gandalf rides for Minas
        Tirith, chief city of Gondor, taking Pippin with him.
